This immutability is a key feature that ensures data integrity by preventing unintended modifications to the data. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This immutability guarantees that the data remains consistent throughout the program's execution. For example, if a tuple is passed to a function, the function cannot modify its contents, ensuring the original data remains intact. Its immutability is the reason of it to maintain data integrity in python as python doesnot allow you to change data elements stored in tuples."
