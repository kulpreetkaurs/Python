        "   - Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It restricts direct access to some components of an object and provides controlled access through methods. This helps in protecting the internal state of an object from unintended interference and misuse.In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers like private (\"__\") and protected (\"_\") to control the visibility of attributes and methods. However, Python enforces access control through convention rather than strict enforcement.\n",
        "   - Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows you to represent essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. This helps in managing complexity by separating what an object does (methods) from how it achieves it (implementation details).In Python, abstraction is often achieved through the use of abstract base classes (ABCs). ABCs define a common interface that subclasses are expected to implement. This allows you to specify what methods must be present in a class without providing a complete implementation.\n",

The result of that evaluation shadows your function definition. A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance. A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class.They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. For example, it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.\n",

        "    - Method chaining in Python object-oriented programming is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement, allowing for more concise and readable code. Each method involved in the chain typically returns the object itself (self), enabling subsequent method calls on the same instance.\n",

        "      - Return self from Methods: In a class, methods that you want to chain should return the instance (self) at the end.\n",
